    <b> The Important Stuff</b><p></p>
<b>How it works:</b><p></p>
The intraweb is made up of a lot of <em>'components'.'</em>  These components work together in unsion. <br>
When we go to a web page the device we are using sends an <em>HTTP</em> request to the server for that page.<br>
The server sifts through the ginormous amount of documents on the web to find the <b>right</b> one & sends<br>
it back to the end user's browser (like IE) then sorts the information and makes it appear <br>
on their screen.<p></p>
<b>HTML</b><p></p>
HTML is an acronym that stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage.<br>
It is the common language of the internet.  It contains <em>text</em> content that describes what is seen <br>
and  <em>mark up</em> that determines how the content looks.<p></p>
<b>Tags and Elements</b><p></p>
The HTML documents are made up of elements.  We use tags to tell the browser what type of elelment.<p></p>
<b>PC's Stupid?'</b> <p></>
Computers simply interpret what they're told ~ nothing more.  With this in mind, errors caused by <br>
programmers can cause really big problems!<br>
<b>Inline and Block Elements</b><p></p>
HTML elements are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block.</em>  Block elements form a <br>
perimter around the content inside of them, like a forcefield.<p>
